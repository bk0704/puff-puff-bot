While weed is rarely ever laced with any other substance as it's not profitable to do so, there is one form of weed that you need to be careful of while are street carts\n\n why should you avoid them? well unlike normal weed they can sometimes be cut for profit with things such as vitamin E, nicotine, or rarely spice(however that's more common in europe than north america)\n\n**if weed is legal where you live go to the dispensary, otherwise just stick to flower it's not worth it**

**Here's why if you're buying dry flower weed then your stuff will probably not be laced**\non the news you might hear stories about weed being laced with terrible shit such as fentanyl, crack, meth, heroin, and angel dust.\nHere are the facts tho:\n- unless you are buying edibles, pre-rolls, carts and ground bud illegally then it is more profitable to just give you the weed then it is to lace it\n- if you do buy street edibles then just know that you're not getting 500mg, 500mg if you aren't enzyme deficient will send you into a coma\n- pre-rolls, carts and ground bud all come with the risk of it being laced with spice(or even is spice) so do not buy those if you live in an illegal state/country just stick to bud or make your own concentrate\n- now hypothetically(with bud this is extremely rare, this isn't to fear-monger people so don't shit your pants) if the person giving you the bud is an evil asshole that want's to ruin your life then the most likely cuts would be some sort of liquid spice or angel dust. Both of which would make weed cheaper to just sell it on its own
